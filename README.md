# Hello there, I'm Fabian!
I am 20 years old and I live in Germany.

I'm a self taught programmer and have been pursuing this wonderful hobby since
my early teen years. Later I got proper education.

I am now working as a Full Stack software developer.

## Programming languages I like
(And also some that I just used in the past)
