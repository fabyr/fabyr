# Hello there, I'm Fabian!
I am 18 years old and I live in Germany.

I'm a self taught programmer and have been doing so since
my early teen years.

Since recently i've been attending a special school for IT and
software development to improve my skills further and to get a degree.

## Programming languages I like
(And also some that i just used in the past)

## Topics i like
- :man_technologist: General Purpose Software development (Preferably with C#)
- :brain: Machine Learning
- :computer: Embedded Systems Programming
- :no_entry: IT security
- :lock: Cryptography

## Github :octocat:
I sadly have joined github very late during my programming journey and 
as such most of my projects are lost to history.

Furthermore I have been using a Linux operating system (Mint) for a while now,
so it would be of no use for me to develop more WinForms applications/let my old projects reincarnate.
(Because that's what i mainly did with C# prior to my operating system switch)

Well anyway, thanks for taking the time to read my readme. :blush:

I hope you're gonna have a very nice day!! :sparkles::sparkles:
